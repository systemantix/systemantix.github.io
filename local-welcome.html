            <h1 class="heading-2">Overview</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Local Welcome makes it fun and easy to cook and eat with refugees in your community. In a divided world, making the time to connect with someone different from yourself is a radical act. We use the magic of food to bring people together, connect and share their stories. You might start cooking together as strangers, but you’ll end up eating as friends.<br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">I was approached by the founder of the organisation, Ben Pollard, to come on board and assist in a service design capacity. Local Welcome worked with vulnerable people, including the elderly, veterans and refugees and members of small community groups to organise shared meals. This was a complex service delivery task, as Local Welcome managed ingredient delivery, ensuring both meal prep and the wellbeing of anyone attending.<br/><br/>I worked with the operational and delivery team to define the structure of the events, and assess how software could be used to facilitate the events.<br/><br/>During a Local Welcome event there&#x27;d be many tables cooking the same meal. Tables would be built up of seven people, with three pairs of cookers and a facilitator. The pairs would be made up of a refugee guest and a community member. The facilitator would be in charge of supervising the cooking and issuing new instructions for meal prep. <br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Encouraging empathy</h1>
            <div class="text-block">The role of the facilitator was not necessarily just to deliver the next cooking instructions, but to also prompt the pairs cooking with questions that may encourage an emotional connection.<br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">However during pilot events we ran, we received consistent feedback from both members of the pairs that the delivery of instructions paired with conversation prompts felt forced. The facilitator issuing both a cooking instruction and a conversation prompt also suffered from the problem of &#x27;infobesity&#x27; - where being issued with an instruction and a personal question was too much to take in at once. We went back to the drawing board to assess how we could encourage conversation in an organic way.<br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">We tested on-table displays using iPads to show the instructions at different intervals, the MVP of this was an iPad running Telegram with each pair being added to a &#x27;broadcast&#x27; channel. Fortunately this worked well and mitigated concerns of a forceful conversation.<br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">iPads however, ran into other problems: <br/><br/>- The cost of these devices was particularly high, and delivering any number of these to the participants running the event would be both expensive and came with the risk of breakage.<br/>‍<br/>- iPads used a precious amount of real-estate on the tables. Having one device would mean that not everyone around the table would be able to see the prompts, and many devices would use the space required for meal preparation and ingredients. <br/>‍<br/>- Text size was an issue. It was also quite likely that the folks delivering the event wouldn&#x27;t know how to increase text size on the devices, so accessibility became a concern.<br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">We were somewhat content with the approach, and opted for the second pilot of this to run with the devices people already had in their pockets; thus mitigating the logistical concern of mailing iPads out for for a single event. As phone numbers were already being collected for safeguarding reasons, we began adding the participants of the events into a single WhatsApp group that would issue prompts. The prompts were no longer in the control of the facilitator on each table, but were issued at the same time to all participants.<br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Conclusion</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Service designers have a far more complex toolkit to deploy, dealing with all avenues of communication with the &#x27;users&#x27; - for example, at Local Welcome we spent a great deal of time putting together a well-considered invite process that felt exclusive. We couldn&#x27;t make any assumptions as to who knew what, and so getting the events to a place where we could issue an ingredients box and some instructions to an organiser and let the events run in a safe, controlled environment was tough. I&#x27;m eager to spend more time looking at service design problems, but this is by no means my forte.<br/></div>
