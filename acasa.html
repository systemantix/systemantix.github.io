            <div class="text-block">I joined Acasa relatively early on in its life, and at that point in time it was known as Splittable. It existed as a simple manual cost entry product which would keep tabs on who owes you what. The product was intended to be scoped to use by housemates, but ultimately was used by more than the target demographic.<br/><br/>I was the only designer on the team. I came in early on in my career and honestly? I came in guns-a-blazing. My intentions were idealistic: incredible usability and a product that worked for everyone - what I came to learn over the two years of building this product was quite how tough early stage companies can be, and even the simplest feature implementation can take weeks of time given the wrong circumstances and mindset.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">At the heart of the product at the time was a component known as the &#x27;all squared meter&#x27;, which would give users a visual representation of their debt or credit within a specified group. This component suffered from a couple of different issues which would become clearer to me over time. The above shot was the iOS app at the time, and the Android app is below.<br/></div>
            <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f316c30bb031b4a794fa767/5f35437322dcee1c86862b44_screen-shot-2015-04-25-at-17-54-04.png" width="939" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f316c30bb031b4a794fa767/5f35437322dcee1c86862b44_screen-shot-2015-04-25-at-17-54-04-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f316c30bb031b4a794fa767/5f35437322dcee1c86862b44_screen-shot-2015-04-25-at-17-54-04.png 654w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 939px" alt=""/>
            <div class="text-block">My first instinct as a designer was that the fragmentation across both our Android and iOS clients in terms of usability was a detriment to the product&#x27;s value proposition. For example, housemates would ask one another how to do certain things inside the app and find inconsistencies in both experience and features when talking to their Android or iOS-wielding counterparts. I began raising the need to build consistency into our products across both platforms, and fortunately the team agreed - however the timeline to achieving this was longer than expected due to business constraints of both funding (to subsequently hire a native Android developer) and design and build time of a fresh new client.<br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">A first-order problem: fragmentation</h1>
            <div class="text-block">My first instinct as a designer was that the fragmentation across both our Android and iOS clients in terms of usability was a detriment to the product&#x27;s value proposition. For example, if two users were to ask one another how to do certain things inside the app and find inconsistencies in both experience and features when talking to their Android or iOS-wielding counterparts. We even experienced this friction within the team.<br/><br/>I sought advice on where to start, and fortunately a neighbouring startup, &#x27;<a href="http://monzo.com">Mondo</a>&#x27; had an experienced head of design in house. I tweeted him and we had a coffee. Over this conversation I began drawing up a design strategy in my head. The advice, in short, was to <em>pick my battles</em>. So in turn, drew my focus to the iOS app. I started overhauling certain components within the app to feel more native by embracing well-established iOS design patterns (Human Interface Guidelines). This in the long term would make any native Android efforts in future a far simpler process.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">The iOS app was utilising a non HIG-compliant app navigation structure - where a couple of icons along the bottom were split in functionality. The recurring transactions button and the non-recurring transactions button would navigate the user into a view they would have to exit out of to then continue exploring the product, and the add cost button would send a user down a whole separate flow. This was a great opportunity to begin introducing HIG-compliant design patterns into the iOS app. On top of this, the separation of non-recurring costs and recurring costs often resulted in empty states being the first thing a user saw.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the company was planning on integrating a payments solution within the product, and so we needed to make space for users to be able to transact within the app. This was important enough from a strategy point of view to find a place for it at the top level of the product.<br/></div>
            <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f316c30bb031b4a794fa767/5f355d2f72cfa93437445bb1_ezgif-7-cf6790afa61b.gif" width="939" alt=""/>
            <div class="text-block">I consolidated both recurring costs and non-recurring costs into one view (in this prototype dubbed &#x27;Transactions&#x27; - the copy at this point was not final, but would in future account for both payments between people and costs logged to the house), and moved the All Squared Meter into the &#x27;Dashboard&#x27; view to give users a glanceable overview of their position in the house.<br/><br/>Of course the information architecture overhaul of the product was no small feat, and convincing stakeholders that this was the right move for the product was a challenge. However, usability testing and research produced evidence to suggest this was going to be a step forward.<br/><br/>It&#x27;s important to note here that while the Tab Bar along the bottom wasn&#x27;t totally conforming to the Human Interface Guidelines, the &#x27;fan&#x27; interaction sparked a moment of joy when usability testing and so we kept it. This little prototype was made using an early version of Framer (back in the CoffeeScript days). <br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Rethinking the &#x27;All Squared Meter&#x27; and introducing payments</h1>
            <div class="text-block">The All Squared Meter existed to provide visibility of the household&#x27;s individual debt or credit. However, with the introduction of payments we could make smart decisions on the backend to suggest payments that users could make to settle up. We were running out of real-estate in the product to add features gracefully, and so I set my sights on the All Squared Meter. <br/><br/>The issues I found with it when usability testing were the following: <br/><br/>- Readability was a problem. Users would have to move their eyes left/right over and over. The <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/KopiMaheswaran/compositional-flow-of-information" target="_blank">compositional flow</a> was poor.<br/>‍<br/>- The ASM didn&#x27;t visually communicate the proportional amount of debt or credit that each user held, instead you&#x27;d still have to read the actual number to get a gist. Simply put: the length of the bars were assumed by users to be an accurate representation of credit or debt, but they were actually just visual.<br/><br/>- If there were only two users (a frequent use case - couples, for example) the ASM would use a huge amount of screen real-estate for what it was doing.<br/><br/>Moving to address the issue of compositional flow and readability, I experimented with horizontal displays of the same information. As a byproduct of this approach, the debt and credit labels, including name could be placed in a row.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">With the same component now taking a lot less screen real-estate, we had a place to offer our suggested payments. This of course also served as a space to onboard users into the new &#x27;Pay with Splittable&#x27; feature.<br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Going native on Android</h1>
            <div class="text-block">As we intended to solve the fragmentation between both the iOS and Android apps, we opted to move from our existing &#x27;hybrid&#x27; Android application to a native one. The step-change in user experience was something our users were also requesting for some time, so I&#x27;d already been quietly working away at a future native Android experience.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">After rolling out the native Splittable app on Android we were met with a lot of praise from our Android user base, who had been wanting this for quite some time. Working with Material design as opposed to HIG didn&#x27;t pose a huge issue, as there were a huge library of components that matched the iOS counterpart. Of course, Material had some other considerations to make - for example, the app was now going to be working on a huge number of device screen sizes - and so the UI could appear smaller or larger than expected. To mitigate this I designed all views at 1x (360x640) and worked closely with our Android engineer during implementation. Certain interactions and patterns had to move into Material compliant versions - for example, the &#x27;fan&#x27; interaction from iOS:<br/></div>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Responding to a shift in company strategy </h1>
            <div class="text-block">Following a successful round of fundraising, the company turned its focus from from user acquisition and to monetisation and retention.<br/><br/>Working with an external agency we rebranded to &#x27;Acasa&#x27; - with the intention of being solely focused on the home. The bill splitting functionality in the app would become second-order to the planned features. Among these features were:<br/><br/>- Booking cleaners/electricians/plumbers through the app <br/>- Setting up and managing your energy through the app, including electricity and gas<br/>- Setting up and managing your water supply through the app <br/>- Setting up your internet through the app<br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">Once a new identity was settled upon by both the team and the agency, I began work on overhauling the visual design of the apps - which was (at the time) rocking inconsistent typography, grids, and colours. <br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">Suggested payments as they existed now presented themselves as &#x27;cards&#x27; on the home view, as opposed to list items. This also became a space to surface our provider integrations such as energy or internet. The visual overhaul of the product was the cherry on top of a months long rebrand and strategy product, and it was a great day to get all of this live.<br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Conclusion</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Acasa was truly a place I grew as a designer. Even some of the shots above are hard to look at nowadays... I see a misalignment here, or poor typographic choices there. Overall, I was given two years of total autonomy early in my career to work on and overhaul a product. I delivered what stakeholders and investors required of me, and evangelised the company. I also made a huge number of mistakes and I embrace the change that they encouraged in me professionally. <br/><br/>Two years of work is tough to place into a single case study, but I intend in future to spend a little more time on another - namely the work we did on introducing energy, internet and water setup and management into the app. Ask me about it sometime.<br/></div>
