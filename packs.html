               <h1 class="heading">Packs</h1>
               <p class="paragraph">Packs is an iOS and Android game that I worked on with two friends over the course of a year. It is a love letter to my favourite tabletop card game, Set.<br/></p>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Overview</h1>
            <div class="text-block">A dear friend of mine introduced me to a tabletop game known as Set in 2017, and honestly? I was terrible at it. I played it once or twice with him, and one day we were playing and it &#x27;clicked&#x27;. I became obsessed. It was the best game I had ever played: I could start it whenever, wherever; I could play with any number of people (including just me) and it felt <em>smart. </em>I took a deck with me everywhere I went, I&#x27;d play it on planes and trains - often dragging in any number of people to play with me.<br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">I was living with two game designers over the period of time I&#x27;d developed this addiction, and so they encouraged me to port it to mobile. I suggested this to a friend of mine and we over the course of a couple of hours built a simple prototype of the game on mobile. It was built using React Native as opposed to a traditional game engine. <br/></div>
            <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f316c30bb031b4a794fa767/5f39106fbba6e97624e1c40d_SetCards.jpg" width="1032" alt="" class="image-4"/>
            <h1 class="heading-2">The rules</h1>
            <div class="text-block">The ruleset is very simple, but carries nuances that are often tough to communicate even verbally. The game works as follows:<br/><br/>- There are 81 unique cards<br/>- Each card has a unique arrangement of shapes, colours, patterns, and number of shapes<br/>- To find a set you must find three cards that are unique across one or more attributes, or the same across one ore more attributes. <br/><br/>The quick check of whether or not 3 cards constitute a Set is: <br/><br/><em>If 2 cards are the same and 1 card is different in any feature, then it is not a set. For example, if 2 are red and 1 is purple then it is not a set. A set must be either all the same OR all different in each individual feature.<br/></em>‚Äç<br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Learning new design principles</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Game design was something I had limited experience with in the past, but was something I was deeply interested in exploring. I spoke to my game designer friends and consulted game design academic literature to find out guiding principles of game design. I learnt of terms such as &#x27;game loop&#x27;, and redefined certain concepts I already had in my repertoire (&#x27;feedback loop&#x27;, for example). Game design didn&#x27;t focus on &#x27;reducing friction&#x27; but rather focused on creating the right kind of friction. Your intention as a designer in this context is to challenge the user and then subsequently reward them for completing those challenges. <br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Porting from IRL to mobile</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Fortunately, the game&#x27;s mechanics had already been well defined. We had the challenge of establishing a great user experience on mobile. The first order of business was finding a good grid size as well as deciding on a good size for cards and symbols. We did this using solid block colours and tested against the smallest screen size on iOS.<br/></div>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Establishing the grid</h1>
            <div class="text-block">We tested the layout in both horizontal and vertical orientations and settled on vertical so that people could play the game one-handed - ideal for an on the fly, quick puzzle game. <br/><br/>The red space along the top was just space reserved for the pause button as well as a &#x27;points&#x27; indicator. We would later move these down to the bottom of the screen for a better one-handed user experience.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">I reimplemented the UI to capture the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_feel">game feel</a> of the tabletop game using different shapes for trademark reasons. Initially we opted for the original colours of the game, but felt these weren&#x27;t particularly accessible for certain colourblindness types. We also increased the size of the shapes inside and corrected optical alignment of the shapes by altering their sizes slightly. <a href="#"></a><br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">We continuously developed the visual language of the game and decided to try and capture a sense of nostalgia - doodles and paper became part of the visual identity later. This all stemmed from the idea that this game could have been something you could have doodled in the back of your school books.<a href="#"></a><br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Scoring and game modes </h1>
            <div class="text-block">I experimented with a couple of game mode ideas:<br/><br/>- Survival, a game mode where each pack found would increase the time you had to find more packs, and any mistakes would reduce your time. This game mode&#x27;s scoring mechanism would be the time you survived.<br/><br/>- Zen mode, a non-timed game mode where you would collect packs at your own pace with no points. This game mode&#x27;s scoring mechanism was undecided.<br/><br/>- Multiplayer, a hypothetical device-to-device game mode where you could compete with others. The scoring mechanism for this game mode was simply &#x27;who won&#x27;. <br/><br/>Ultimately, we scrapped Survival as analytics showed that only 3% of our testers (100 players) were playing it regularly. People by and large preferred the Zen game mode with a 99% play rate. We tried a couple of different scoring mechanisms and settled on one that prioritised speed of play: packs per minute. Over the course of a game we could provide a player with a rolling average of their speed of play, making the game far more competitive. After we&#x27;d settled on scoring, we built a leaderboard to encourage an arcade style of play - where players would compete for the number #1 spot amongst their friends.<br/><br/>Later we also created a simplified game mode for a better gameplay experience of first-time players.<a href="#"></a><br/></div>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Conclusion</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Packs was an interesting deep dive into the game design and development process. It of course shares similarities with product design, but the difference is that the fidelity of the prototypes should be as high as possible from day 1. Capturing a game&#x27;s feeling and whether or not it&#x27;s &#x27;fun&#x27; is something that requires a lot of trial and error. Packs took over a year to get out there, and the design process was scattered throughout that year. However, it remains one of my favourite projects in terms of process and ultimately the output. People worldwide are playing the game, and the multiplayer game mode is awesome. You can check it out <a href="http://packsgame.com">here</a>. The game is available for both iOS and Android... and soon, Nintendo Switch and web.<a href="#"></a><br/></div>
