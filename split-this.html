               <p class="paragraph">After receiving a grant of Â£50,000 to pursue my own ideas, I built a product team around me and aimed to solve the problem of shared finances.</p>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Vision</h1>
            <div class="text-block">I&#x27;ve been living in London for what is now coming up to 5 years. I&#x27;ve been here for a while, and as a young professional in this city I time and time again face the same issue of shared finances. Listen, I can&#x27;t afford a house! I need to rent. So tell me, how do I navigate the complexity of shared finances with a group of people I might not even know?<br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">I had this idea stirring in my head since my time at Acasa, and I very much consider Split This very much a spiritual successor to the bill splitting functionality inside their product. <br/><br/>I sought out to solve the problem space of shared finance from another angle altogether given the arrival of new technologies that could support a paradigm shift in user experience.<br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Competitive analysis</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Some context I&#x27;d built up over the years of trying various bill splitting apps was that they relied on the mental model of a &#x27;group&#x27;. For example, you would tend to sign up to the app and manually log costs. A spreadsheet, simply put. For each cost you would add to the app you&#x27;d have to assign it to a group - this would then send out the relevant requests of the right amounts to each of your group&#x27;s members. <br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">A new mental model</h1>
            <div class="text-block">I spent some months conducting user research by speaking to my assumed user base about their experiences. Over the conversations that followed it became clear that the group mental model was not the one users&#x27; would be using in these contexts. People would rarely would associate debt with their &#x27;house&#x27; group, but rather the members of their household as individuals. Costs weren&#x27;t to be split within these contexts - they were peer to peer. To illustrate:<br/><br/>Josh and Justin live together. They also holiday together. They cannot settle up for their &#x27;house&#x27; spending in isolation without accounting for their &#x27;holiday&#x27; spending. If we were to use the groups mental model here they would have to consolidate their spending within a group and settle up. If we use the peer-to-peer mental model, they can consolidate across different &#x27;groups&#x27; or contexts of spending. <br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Home screen and core views</h1>
            <div class="text-block">The home screen of the product intended to convey a couple of key things: <br/><br/>- How much you as an individual owe across all of your groups<br/>- How much you are owed across all of your groups<br/>- What shared spending you were involved in across all of your groups<br/><br/>Costs associated with groups were signified by the group badge assigned to it during its creation.<br/><br/>The cost &#x27;chat&#x27; view was a necessity due to wanting feature parity with competing products. Typically, other products would allow you to enter a cost &#x27;details&#x27; view, allowing you to attach images of receipts or leave notes. We validated the assumption through testing that a chat feed would be the simplest possible way of adding all of these user stories in a graceful and familiar way. <br/></div>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Awareness of new technologies</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Prior to the supposed release of the open banking ecosystem, <a href="http://teller.io" target="_blank">Teller.io</a> had already built functional APIs for most banks within the UK - including read and write. Meaning we could know when a user spent on an existing payment card, and subsequently present them with a notification to split that cost on the fly. This innovation would allow us to avoid altogether a manual cost entry flow and become a glorified spreadsheeting app. We opted for Teller over any other open banking provider as their authorisation flows were well considered and their technology didn&#x27;t rely on rudimentary techniques such as screen scraping banking providers. <br/></div>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Manual entry made lightweight</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Manual entry however, was still a very possible and frequent use-case. We couldn&#x27;t hedge our bets on open banking features as they&#x27;d be the last to roll out. I designed a minimal cost entry flow that supported a multitude of currencies, as well as allowing you to split costs with individuals outside of groups. <br/></div>
