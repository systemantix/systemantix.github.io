            <div class="text-block">In mid-2018, Improbable&#x27;s core product offerings were an SDK for both Unreal and Unity game engines known as SpatialOS. SpatialOS, simply put, was an SDK that would integrate into a game engine to allow game developers to build games with massive scale and persistence. I was given the autonomy to integrate into the team as I saw best, so I set off on a research journey which would lead to the formation of a new product, and subsequently unlock product market fit. <br/><br/>In an engineering-first organisation you find yourself as a designer constantly battling with abstract concepts that you need to design around, and SpatialOS was no different. It was a complex toolkit with many facets, including documentation, getting started guides, and a whole new way of writing code that needed to be communicated for the end user. <br/><br/>I began by into the SDKs and the documentation as they stood at that point in time for both Unity and Unreal, building simple SpatialOS prototypes to better understand how the technology worked. I had some experience in game development by this point, so fortunately the game engine environment was relatively familiar. <br/></div>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Evidence gathering</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Upon auditing all of the SDKS, APIs and supplementary tooling we&#x27;d already built around SpatialOS, I began logging areas of redundancy in workflow. My hypothesis in this period of time became that game development time <em>with SpatialOS</em> was longer than <em>without SpatialOS.</em> To validate this assumption, I began running user research sessions with various user types found in game studios. Fortunately, Improbable had a lot of in-house game designers, developers and producers to speak to.<br/><br/>After running approximately ~50 of these sessions alongside the Head of Design and a fellow Product Designer, it became abundantly clear that the hypothesis was indeed correct. The various pieces of tooling to learn, paired with the new asynchronous mental model that game developers needed to learn meant that game iteration times were approximately 30% slower. In a AAA setting this kind of time add to a game&#x27;s turnaround was unacceptable. Feedback from producers here was key in validating this assumption. <br/><br/>We&#x27;d logged a huge amount of evidence on Airtable (specific feedback notes on the SpatialOS SDK) and Figma (journey mapping of the user stories associated with SpatialOS). A common critical theme that cropped up was &#x27;context switching&#x27;. Engineers were frustrated by their need to context switch. <br/></div>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Prototyping</h1>
            <div class="text-block">Given the same evidence, the design team split to spend a month ideating and prototyping different approaches and ideas to speed up the build and iteration time of the SDK. This was to ensure that any of our biases wouldn&#x27;t wind up encouraging cyclical ideas. <br/><br/>My strengths within the design team lay in prototyping within the game engine context, and so I took to Unity to test various approaches to reducing iteration and build time. Improbable already had a product at the time known as the Inspector, which had the job of allowing developers to inspect live deployments against SpatialOS, one of my first ideas was to bring Inspector functionality into the engine environment, thus reducing the need to context switch in the first place.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">Early concepts I designed experimented with the idea of overlaying Entity information within the playable prototype inside Unity utilising an engine-level flag. However, upon speaking to engineers I found that while this was a technically feasible approach, it would only be able to show abut complex approach, and would potentially get in the way of the game itself. We could not make assumptions as to what kind of game would be built, and whether or not it would have its own HUD controllers.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">A later idea was to bring the entire Inspector tooling inside the engine itself, however we found that even with the use of Unity&#x27;s &#x27;tabbed&#x27; views design pattern, we&#x27;d be bringing the Inspector and it&#x27;s complex &#x27;querying&#x27; functionality inside an already complex piece of tooling. Upon conversations with the PM on our team, we went back to the drawing board to think about how this technology may work within 3D space, as opposed to moving one piece of tooling within another.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">I began building various concepts within Unity, designing my own player character and building shaders objects to communicate to engineers which &#x27;worker server&#x27; they were being controlled by (described through their names - UnityFSim1 and UnityFSim2 in the above prototypes). I worked alongside head of engineering on our team to build out a &#x27;real&#x27; prototype of this that integrated the SpatialOS networking stack. It worked a treat, but this sent us brainstorming in a new direction altogether - what if we introduced the SpatialOS networking stack into the game engine itself, and abstracted away all of SpatialOS&#x27;s concepts. This prototype existed as the first prototype of the GDKs (Game Development Kits). The game development kits were built with the philosophy of maintaining <strong>familiar workflows</strong>.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">The GDKs quickly ballooned into an engineering spike, and were subsequently defined by the wider team as <em>game engine forks and SpatialOS starter templates</em> that mirrored the already known Unreal and Unity starter projects. This would enable game developers to work with familiar workflows without compromising on their game&#x27;s vision. <br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">The GDK project took on a life of its own, rallying the entire Develop team onto it. As it was a design light project and would require the entire engineering team I moved my sights onto a new project known as &#x27;Union&#x27;. <br/><br/>Working directly with the VP of Engineering and Director of Partnerships, we prototyped and built a new version of the SpatialOS Launcher (a simple tool that would allow you to connect and play live deployments of games without installing). <br/><br/>Spatial Union was built as an internal tool to enable Improbable employees and our partner game studios to playtest new games as they were being built, enabling our partner studios to tighten feedback loops on their new game mechanics and features. <br/></div>
