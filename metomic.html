            <h1 class="heading-2">Overview</h1>
            <div class="text-block">When I joined the company, Metomic had just left Entrepreneur First and received its first round of funding. They had an MVP cookie banner product which was far more usable than the products out there at the time.<br/><br/>We set out initially to overhaul the way people interacted with cookies on the web, setting a high bar for usability and transparency. This required a deep knowledge of the EU&#x27;s GDPR regulation and the CCPA that rolled out months earlier.<br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">A cookie banner, on the surface, was surely not a particularly complex product to put together... Oh how wrong I was. <br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Competitor analysis</h1>
            <div class="text-block">I started by assessing the state of cookie consent management products across the web. Fortunately however, I had a huge number of reference points from just having used the internet. The bar wasn&#x27;t very high. The design patterns I was typically coming across were modals, sidebars and banners. At the best of times, these products would be discrete, and at the worse of times they would use a huge amount of real-estate on the webpage, as well as forcefully collect your consent. <br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">Over the course of a weekend, I prototyped cookie consent in various different design patterns to assess their &#x27;feel&#x27; on the webpage. I experimented with a multitude of design patterns, positions on the webpage and amounts of copy. The copy posed a challenge in and of itself: we needed to succinctly communicate to anyone viewing a webpage what each cookie being dropped was, as well as the legal justification for its use. <br/></div>
            <h1 class="heading-2">Build</h1>
            <div class="text-block">After this extensive prototyping, I landed on what I felt to be the strongest approach: utilising a &#x27;widget&#x27; pattern. <br/></div>

            <div class="text-block"><em>A client I brought to the company </em><br/></div>
            <div class="text-block">The &#x27;widget&#x27; design pattern was an idea that came to me after an analysis of other such products that would be &#x27;installed&#x27; onto a company&#x27;s website - namely Intercom. One of Metomic&#x27;s goals with this product was establishing a brand identity across the Internet, and so the identity of the widget was key. After presenting this to the remainder of the team we settled on a &#x27;switch&#x27; icon to widen our brand identity and link it conceptually with ideas of &#x27;consent&#x27; and on the internet.<br/></div>

One of Metomic&#x27;s goals with this product was establishing a brand identity across the Internet, and so choosing something simple and recognisable was part of my decision making here. We eventually changed this icon to an abstraction of a &#x27;lock&#x27; to avoid the usability concerns of the switch icon.<br/><br/>We also introduced a method of collecting consent via scroll in a far more ethical way than what was already being done on the web:<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">Following the build of the cookie widget, we launched it on Product Hunt to some hype, garnering 1000 upvotes that day. The cookie widget remains the highest voted cookie consent manager on Product Hunt, and within the week had been deployed on hundreds of sites. Managing the launch of this on Product Hunt alongside the team to this day remains one of the more stressful but fulfilling working days of my life.<br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">Following the build of of the cookie widget, I began paying closer attention to the business facing dashboard behind the scenes. The original dashboard I&#x27;d designed within the time constraints leading to our PH launch was lacking. And with the introduction of new features such as contextual consent (covered further in this case study) was beginning to outgrow itself in terms of both usability and visual design. <br/></div>

            <div class="text-block">I went back to the drawing board and ran the same discovery process I&#x27;d used for designing the widget itself. Our dashboard was both for a non-technical and technical audiences, so usability and flexibility over the products was paramount. <br/><br/>The views presented above and below are not of the same view, however show off some of the visual design overhauls.<br/></div>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Onboarding</h1>
            <div class="text-block">The onboarding of the cookie widget was a fairly complex design challenge, as the number of cookies dropped from any site was usually something nor a developer nor site owner would usually have any idea of. This was a byproduct of any number of scripts running on the site (for example, Google Analytics, Intercom, Stripe, etc). <br/><br/>The engineering team had been working on a website scanning technology that would automatically detect any cookies being dropped. When this tech was ready, we rebuilt the onboarding to be the slickest possible experience for you, irrespective of how many cookies your site dropped or how technical you were:<br/></div>
